## 🧠 Overview

**Theia** is a clinical decision support tool developed to predict the **rate of cognitive and functional decline** in individuals living with dementia. This tool uses machine learning techniques and routinely collected clinical assessment data to support personalised prognosis and care planning.

Sometimes, simple paper‑and‑pencil cognitive and functional tests can outperform MRI scans when it comes to predicting how Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment will progress. This finding doesn’t undermine the importance of neuroimaging. Instead, it highlights the need for balanced, pragmatic approaches to dementia care, combining accessible cognitive and functional assessments with advanced technologies to better estimate trajectories and health and care needs.

This repository includes code, data-processing notebooks, and documentation used in the study.
